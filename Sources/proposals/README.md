# ``/proposals``

The unified codelink format (UCF) is a set of extensions to the DocC symbol link format. It is intended to allow developers to incrementally adopt advanced features while reducing the amount of reformatting needed to upgrade existing documentation.

This module defines the example symbols used in the various proposals and articles. It does not contain the UCF implementation, which lives in the [swift-unidoc](https://github.com/tayloraswift/swift-unidoc) repository.
